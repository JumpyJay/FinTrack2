# FinTrack by Finnovations

FinTrack is a comprehensive budget tracking and financial management application designed to empower users to take control of their finances seamlessly.

This Independent Software Development Project (CP2106) [a.k.a. Orbital] is done up by Jaymeson Koh, and Kanit Bhudisanont. Advised by Aakash Ramaswamy. The code uses React Native for mobile development.

## Motivation

In recent years, the escalating Consumer Price Index (CPI) of items, exacerbated by global inflation and recent GST hikes, has posed significant challenges for individuals striving to maintain their desired lifestyle within their financial means. This economic landscape underscores the critical importance of understanding personal expenditure and making prudent financial decisions to avoid overspending or jeopardising savings due to impulse purchases.

Traditionally, personal finance has been perceived as a dry and overwhelming topic, particularly for beginners. The sheer volume of information available online often leads to information overload, leaving many individuals feeling lost and confused. However, there has been a growing trend, especially among youths, towards achieving financial independence. Yet, the path to financial literacy remains unclear for many due to the lack of engaging resources and the complexities of financial jargon.

## Aim

Our aim is to develop an intuitive and user-friendly finance app that empowers individuals to take charge of their financial well-being. We strive to create a robust platform that simplifies the processes of expense tracking, budget management, and financial goal setting. Moreover, we aim to integrate engaging gamification elements to make the experience more enjoyable and motivating for users.

Additionally, we aim to provide insightful analytics that offer valuable insights into usersâ€™ financial well-being. By fostering a sense of community around financial wellness, we aspire to create a supportive environment where users can learn from each other, seek advice, and celebrate their financial achievements together.
